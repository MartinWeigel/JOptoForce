# JOptoForce

The project aims to ease the use of [OptoForce](http://optoforce.com) sensors for JVM languages.
JOptoForce is a java wrapper for the sensor's serial protocol.
It allows for high-level access to its data, status, and settings.

The library is neither affiliated nor supported by OptoForce Ltd.
It currently supports the OptoForce protocol version 1.3 and 1.4.
